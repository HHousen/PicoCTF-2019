* [Program](./ghostdiary)

## Solution

### Stage 1: Analysis

1. Analysis commands (run on shell server):

    ```
    $ ldd ghostdiary
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc22b9f000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f860ee47000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f860f43b000)

    $ strings /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep GNU
    GNU C Library (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.27-3ubuntu1) stable release version 2.27.
    Compiled by GNU CC version 7.3.0.

    $ checksec ghostdiary
        Arch:     amd64-64-little
        RELRO:    Full RELRO
        Stack:    Canary found
        NX:       NX enabled
        PIE:      PIE enabled
    ```

    The libc version is 2.27 which implies the use of tcache with very little security checks. All protections are enabled, implying a heap only exploit.

2. Test run:

    ```
    -=-=-=[[Ghost Diary]]=-=-=-
    1. New page in diary
    2. Talk with ghost
    3. Listen to ghost
    4. Burn the page
    5. Go to sleep
    > 1
    1. Write on one side?
    2. Write on both sides?
    > 1
    size: 1
    page #0
    1. New page in diary
    2. Talk with ghost
    3. Listen to ghost
    4. Burn the page
    5. Go to sleep
    > 2
    Page: 1
    Content: 1. New page in diary
    2. Talk with ghost
    3. Listen to ghost
    4. Burn the page
    5. Go to sleep
    > 4
    Page: 1
    1. New page in diary
    2. Talk with ghost
    3. Listen to ghost
    4. Burn the page
    5. Go to sleep
    > 5
    bye human!
    ```

    After running, we are given a menu with the following options: New page, Talk with ghost, Listen to ghost, Burn the page, and Go to sleep. We suspect that these operations correspond to a fairly standard heap problem with create, edit, read, delete, and exit.

3. Reverse the binary file using [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) ([cheat sheet](https://ghidra-sre.org/CheatSheet.html)).

    Ghidra failed to decompile `main()`, but this should be okay since it probably only handles the logic that calls the above functions.

    Findings:

    * The `delete_page()` method correctly sets the pointer to NULL after freeing, so any use-after-free exploit will have to work non-trivially.
    * There is a null byte overflow in the edit function.
    * In addition, we can print any chunk, regardless of if it’s freed or not, which we will use to get a libc leak.

### Stage 2: Leak Libc (using a poison null byte)

1. `tcache` bins prevent us from getting a leak normally by freeing unsorted bin. However, each `tcache` bin can only hold a maximum of 7 chunks, letting us easily overflow it. We create 8 chunks in the unsorted bin range, and free them all. The last freed chunk will have a libc address, which we can leak, since it will be freed to a regular bin.
2. Throughout this exploit, we will need to ensure that the `tcache` is filled, or else our freed chunks will go into the tcache and not unsorted bins.
3. This section is somewhat similar to the "zero_to_hero" challenge since we overflow a poison null byte into the next chunk to change the size of the next chunk.
4. In this case, in order to perform null byte poisoning we need 3 chunks (size `0x118` but value is `0x119` because of `PREV_INUSE` bit).

    ```
    0x00    [ 0xdeadbeef  ] [    0x119   ]  A
            [             ...            ]
            [             ...            ]
    0x118   [     ...     ] [    0x119   ]  B
            [             ...            ]
            [             ...            ]
    0x230   [     ...     ] [    0x119   ]  C
            [             ...            ]
            [             ...            ]
    ```

5. We eventually want to shrink chunk B by overwriting the least significant byte of the size header with `0x00`. Thus, the new size of B becomes `0x100`. However, we need to change the `prev_size` value of the chunk following B or else `malloc` will error when it is called. This can be done by writing a fake block header into block B that is `0x100-0x10` bytes after block B's header. Remember, all blocks overlap with the next block by 8 bytes in 64-bit programs (4 bytes in 32-bit). This overlap contains the last 8 bytes of the block if the block is allocated, but if it is unallocated it contains the size of the previous block. We write the size of `0x100` to b`lock_b_header+0xf0` and then free B (to the unsorted list) to setup the backwards consolidation later. We do not write a size to the fake header because `malloc` does not check the size value. Freeing block B changes the `PREV_INUSE` byte of block C, making block C's size value change from `0x121` to `0x120`, to mark the previous block as not in use. It also 

    ```
    0x00    [    0xdeadbeef    ] [      0x121     ]  A
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x118   [        ...       ] [      0x121     ]  B [FREE]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x218   [ 0x100 prev_size  ] [      ...       ]    [FAKE HEADER]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x230   [ 0x120 prev_size  ] [      0x120     ]  C
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
                               ...
    ```

6. We then abuse the null byte overflow to change B’s size. We fill block 7 (block A) with `A`s and the single null byte overflows to change block 8's (block B) size from `0x120` to `0x100`

    ```
    0x00    [    0xdeadbeef    ] [      0x121     ]  A [FREE]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x118   [        ...       ] [      0x100     ]  B [FREE]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x218   [ 0x100 prev_size  ] [      ...       ]    [FAKE HEADER]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x230   [ 0x120 prev_size  ] [      0x120     ]  C
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
                               ...
    ```

7. When `malloc()` is called, it looks on its list for a piece of memory that is big enough. If it finds one, then it removes that memory from the linked list and returns it to the user. When `free()` is called, the memory is put back on the linked list. Now, to be efficient, if there is a chunk of memory on the free list that much bigger than what is requested, then it breaks up that chunk into two chunks: one which is the size of the request (padded to a multiple of 8), and the remainder. The remainder is put on the free list and the one the size of the request is returned to the user. Therefore, running `alloc(0x88)` to create a block of size `0x88` will split the chunk in the unsorted list, which in our case is chunk B of size `0x118`, into `0x88`, as requested by the program, and `0x90` which is the leftover amount.
8. When the block of size `0x88` is requested `malloc` simply returns a pointer to the block of memory. It does not null out the values or set them to zero like `calloc` does. When block B was initially freed to the unsorted list the backwards pointer was overwritten with the address of the unsorted bin list in libc's `main_arena`. Thus, when it is split and the top part is returned we get a block of memory containing a libc address. We can calculate the offset and obtain the libc base address. Fore more information about how `malloc` determines which address to return visit [the MallocInternals glibc wiki page](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals) ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200614010125/https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals)) and read the "Malloc Algorithm" section (although the whole page is great and I recommend reading it all if you are unfamiliar). The image below shows the state of the heap after `malloc(0x88)` is called:

    ```
    0x00    [    0xdeadbeef    ] [      0x121     ]  A
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x118   [        ...       ] [      0x91      ]  B1
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x1a8   [        ...       ] [      0x70      ]  B2  [FREE]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x218   [ 0x70 prev_size   ] [      ...       ]      [FAKE HEADER]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x230   [ 0x120 prev_size  ] [      0x120     ]  C
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
                               ...
    ```

### Stage 3: Overlap chunks and overwrite an address

1. We can call `malloc` again to get our chunk that we’ll collapse over. Specifically, to request a chunk of size `0x30`, leaving a remainder of `0x40` since B2 is being split. The heap now looks like this:

    ```
    0x00    [    0xdeadbeef    ] [      0x121     ]  A
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x118   [        ...       ] [      0x91      ]  B1
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x1a8   [        ...       ] [      0x41      ]  B2
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x1e8   [        ...       ] [      0x30      ]  B3  [FREE]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x218   [ 0x30 prev_size   ] [      ...       ]      [FAKE HEADER]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x230   [ 0x120 prev_size  ] [      0x120     ]  C
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
                               ...
    ```

2. We then free B1 to ensure that a proper `prev_size` header is written:

    ```
    0x00    [    0xdeadbeef    ] [      0x121     ]  A
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x118   [        ...       ] [      0x91      ]  B1  [FREE]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x1a8   [        0x90      ] [      0x40      ]  B2  
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x1e8   [        ...       ] [      0x30      ]  B3  [FREE]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x218   [ 0x30 prev_size   ] [      ...       ]      [FAKE HEADER]
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
    0x230   [ 0x120 prev_size  ] [      0x120     ]  C
            [                  ...                ]
            [                  ...                ]
                               ...
    ```

3. Now, we can free chunk C to backwards consolidate over B2, resulting in overlapping chunks ([this ctf-wiki page](https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/glibc-heap/chunk_extend_overlapping/) might be helpful in understanding overlapping chunks). Since we have overlapping chunks, we control chunk B2 we can free it so it goes in the tcache. Then, we create a chunk of size `0x130` to allocate our consolidated, overlapping chunk into page 0 of the "diary".
4. Next, we overwrite the forward address of chunk B2 with the address of `free_hook` by using our overlapped chunks and writing directly into B2. Also, specify the argument to `system()` to be `/bin/sh`. We request the next block from the tcache list, leaving the head of the list pointing at the forward pointer of the chunk we just freed. We overwrote this forward pointer to `free_hook`. Then, we request the next chunk from the same tcache list. This will return a pointer to `free_hook`. After that, we set the address that page 2 points to, which is actually free_hook, to `system` by editting the page that points to `__free_hook`.
5. We overwrote the `__free_hook` pointer to the `system('/bin/sh')` function. So, now we actually have to use our overwritten memory by calling `free()`, which redirects its actions to whatever function `__free_hook` happens to point to. Fore more info about `__free_hook` see step 2 of "Stage 2: Overwrite an Address" of the "zero_to_hero" writeup.
