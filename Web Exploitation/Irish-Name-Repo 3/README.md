## Solution

1. There is a hidden form field named `debug`. Set it to `1`.
2. Sign in as password: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
3. Decode caesar cipher that is shown: `nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm` with <https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher> to find `13` is the offset
4. Encode `' or '1'='1` with offset `13` with same website to get `' be '1'='1`
5. Paste `' be '1'='1` into password to get flag
