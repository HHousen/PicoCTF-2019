i got the cookie by logging in as username guest password guest
decoded the cookie twice with url decoder
then I decoded what I got from the url decoder into the base64 deoder
got this username and password thing
then I changed the username to admin
and password to ' or''='
then I encoded that in the base64 once
then encoded that to url encoder twice
put that into the cookie
set file to admin
and refreshed the page
and got the flag
